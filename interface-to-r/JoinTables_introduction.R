# key words:
#ã€€... JOIN ... USING ( ... )

# relational database:
# divide the information into several tables
# tables use some values to relate with each other

# scale of relational database is better than non-relational database:
# save time and space;
# update one table when some information changed;
# data is consistent, more easier to process


# same as merge() in R
# we have one variable (field) as key or identifier
# use JOIN options in SELECT

# 4 types of JOIN
# INNER JOIN or just JOIN: retrain table in common
# LEFT JOIN or just LEFT JOIN: retain the 1st table
# RIGHT JOIN or just RIGHT JOIN: retain the 2nd table
# FULL JOIN or just FULL JOIN: retain all the table

# example
# find the average salaries of players with top 10 highest homerun average
